SoundSpel is a reform spelling system that makes English spelling simple and regular, while preserving continuity from traditional spelling. Its great advantage over other reform spelling systems is that it is easier to learn, and particularly easy to read, for those raised with traditional spelling. Specifically, Soundspel:

- Does not introduce any new symbols, thus making it compatible with the current (QWERTY) keyboard.
- Relies upon familiar digraphs.
- Does not assign unusual notations for sounds (ex. using q for the ng sound), except for 'uu' and 'zh'.
- Does not introduce diacritical marks (such as accents), which are generally not favored in English-speaking countries.
- Does not dramatically change the appearance of existing words.
- Keeps the spelling of the 12 most common words, uses s for plurals and possessives, and current 'th' digraph.

A concise summary of SoundSpel rules are:

1. Short vowels are a single letter, as in: sat, set, did, dot, cut
2. Long vowels are followed immediately by an e, as in: sundae, see, die, toe, cue
3. No silent letters
4. Most double letters are removed
5. Consonants such as f, c, s, j, g have a consistent, single sound and spelling

This results in a system that is intuitive and consistent:
